## About me

I am Victor Huesca, a 22 years old student in computer sciences, especialy in hardware design and embedded systems. I am currently studing at [Toulouse's Paul Sabatier University](http://www.univ-tlse3.fr/home/home-page-en-379161.kjsp) in Master Degree of Ingeneering.


## Interships

### Buildroot

I did an internship at [Bootlin (ex Free-Electron)](https://bootlin.com) where I worked on the open-source project [buildroot](https://buildroot.org) under the supervison of [Thomas Petazzoni](http://thomas.enix.org). I did several improvements to the buildroot infrastructure  including:
- Notifications of new upstream versions of packages
- Notifications of defconfig and runtime test failures
- Buildroot autobuilder search capabilities

For futher details about what have been done during this internship, you can see [this blog post](https://bootlin.com/blog/improvements-to-buildroot-maintenance-tooling) from bootlin's website.

### Bioinformatic

I worked at the Montréal University on summer 2018 where I did bioinformatic stuff.
My contribution was to imagine and implement an ammalgamation algorithm in order to improve the LBIT's [GATC](https://github.com/UdeM-LBIT/GATC) software. The amalgamation consist of infering the best genetree possible from a custer of genetree and the species tree.

A few slides about the amalgamation processus can be found here: https://1drv.ms/p/s!AoDeBEP2ychVm4lFRAeGy3IjUgmUsA


## Projects

- I created a basic ***C*** compiler and optimizer in *ocaml*.
- I'am currently woring on a *VHDL* implementation of the MIPS's **R3000** CPU. The code will be available on my github as soon as I am satisfy enought of the it.
